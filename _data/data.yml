      > Low power, Embedded System, On-device AI

      Hello. I've always felt uncomfortable with the current AI because it was too passive. So my goal is to make current AI learn and engage more actively from reality. 
      
      To this end, I've studied AI, embedded systems, and signal processing in my undergraduate years,and have built AI-based tracking drones and lane-detection neural networks that are robust to exter
      nal changes. 
      
      In current, I'm studying on-device AI in [KAIST](https://namu.wiki/w/한국과학기술원)'s [Smile lab](https://sites.google.com/view/smilelab), because I want to study em
      bedded systems and AI more. After that, I'm going to publish my research on on-device learning to mobile computing conferences,such as Mobicom or Sensys.

      - title: Study on improving the flight time of drones using helium
        time: 2018.07 - 2018.12
        team: DeepDroner, Hanyang Academic Town.
        link: "/online-cv/proofs/helium_drone_2018.pdf" 
        tagline: "In order to solve the drone's flight time problem, an attempt is made to fuse with an airship for better flight time. 
        The research was conducted with a grant of $1,300 from the Hanyang University Smart Teaching and Learning Center."

      - title: AI and human tracking drones
        time: 2018.07 - 2019.02
        team: DeepDroner, HX-Corps research team for practical problems
        link: "/online-cv/proofs/deepdroner_2018.pdf"
        tagline: "To address the police's lack of search personnel, we have developed a drone to search for lost children given their image data. 
        At this time, a drone equipped with Jetson TX2 was developed, 
        and the widely used YOLO Network was run on the drone to separate people and objects in real time."

      - title: The Leveling Accuracy Improvement of 3D Printer Using Velostat
        time: 2019.03 - 2019.12
        team: 16Lab, Hanyang Academic Town.
        link: "/online-cv/proofs/leveling_sensor_2019.pdf"
        tagline: "Leveling process is essential in modern 3D printers, 
        but there is a problem that the sensor needs to be calibrated frequently because the nozzle and sensor from 
        which filament is extruded are separated. To solve this problem, 
        we invented a method of integrating a pressure measuring sensor into the bed to position the correct position of the nozzle."

      - title: Autonomous driving program robust to external changes
        time: 2019.03 - 2020.02
        team: 16Lab, HX-Corps research team for practical problems
        link: "/online-cv/proofs/lane_detection_2019.pdf"
        tagline: "In the conventional lane detection algorithm, it was difficult to extract lane features due to saturated pixels under strong sunlight. This was a major cause of accidents in Tesla's autonomous vehicles. In this study, we proposed tanukiNet, 
        a lane detection neural network that is resistant to external environmental changes, 
        and verified it by mounting it on Jetbot."

      - It is a study support program supported by Hanyang University. It is a program that gathers classmates to study together and concentrates on specific subjects for one semester.
      - Hanyang University selects startups with ideas, selects them as start-up clubs and provides grants. At the time, Hanyang University subsidies and other subsidies were combined to run a shared electric bicycle project.
      - Many people have difficulty using Matlab and Github in the campus internet community, so I rented a place and taught it for free.
      - Free bibliographic management programs like Endnote
